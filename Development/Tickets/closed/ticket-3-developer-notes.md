# Developer Notes: Dark Mode Implementation (Ticket #3)

## Overview
This document details the implementation of dark mode functionality for the Investment Education Page. The implementation includes theme toggle, theme persistence, and comprehensive color adaptation for both UI elements and charts.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Modifications (`index.html`)
- Added theme toggle button to the container div:
  ```html
  <div class="theme-toggle">
      <button id="themeToggle" aria-label="Toggle dark mode">
          <i class="fas fa-sun light-icon"></i>
          <i class="fas fa-moon dark-icon"></i>
      </button>
  </div>
  ```
- Positioned at the top-right corner of the page
- Uses Font Awesome icons for visual feedback
- Added ARIA label for accessibility

### 2. CSS Modifications (`styles.css`)

#### Added CSS Variables
Added dark theme color variables to the `:root` section:
```css
--dark-background-color: #121212;
--dark-card-background: #1e1e1e;
--dark-text-color: #e0e0e0;
--dark-text-light: #a0a0a0;
--dark-border-color: #333333;
--dark-input-background: #2a2a2a;
--dark-chart-grid-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
--dark-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
--dark-inflated-color: #ff6b6b;
--dark-investment-color: #5ce892;
--dark-contribution-color: #5dade2;
--dark-initial-color: #bdc3c7;
--dark-info-background: #2a2a2a;
```

#### Added Theme Toggle Styles
- Positioned toggle button with absolute positioning
- Added hover effects and transitions
- Implemented icon visibility toggling based on theme

#### Added Dark Mode Overrides
Created style overrides for all major components in dark mode:
- Base elements (body, text)
- Cards and containers
- Form inputs and controls
- Charts and visualizations
- Buttons and interactive elements
- Summary sections and insights
- Navigation elements
- Footer

### 3. JavaScript Modifications (`script.js`)

#### Theme Management Functions
1. Added `initTheme()` function:
   - Checks localStorage for saved preference
   - Applies theme on initial load
   - Sets up theme toggle listener

2. Added `toggleDarkMode()` function:
   - Toggles dark mode class on body
   - Saves preference to localStorage
   - Triggers chart theme updates

#### Chart Theme Adaptation
1. Added `updateChartsTheme(isDarkMode)` function:
   - Defines theme-specific colors for charts
   - Updates all active charts with new theme

2. Added `updateChartColors(chart, theme)` function:
   - Updates chart grid colors
   - Updates dataset colors
   - Updates chart annotations
   - Maintains color relationships between different data series

3. Added `hexToRgba(hex, alpha)` helper function:
   - Converts hex colors to rgba for backgrounds
   - Maintains proper transparency in both themes

### 4. Chart Color Scheme

#### Light Theme Colors (Default)
- Grid: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)
- Text: #666666
- Initial Amount: #95a5a6
- Inflation: #e74c3c
- Investment: #2ecc71
- Contribution: #3498db

#### Dark Theme Colors
- Grid: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)
- Text: #e0e0e0
- Initial Amount: #bdc3c7
- Inflation: #ff6b6b
- Investment: #5ce892
- Contribution: #5dade2

## Implementation Details

### Theme Toggle Mechanism
1. User clicks theme toggle button
2. `toggleDarkMode()` is called
3. Body class is toggled
4. Theme preference is saved to localStorage
5. Charts are updated via `updateChartsTheme()`

### Chart Theme Update Process
1. New theme colors are defined based on mode
2. Each active chart is updated:
   - Grid colors and text colors
   - Dataset colors and fills
   - Annotation colors
3. Charts are redrawn with new colors

### Theme Persistence
- Theme preference is stored in localStorage as 'darkMode'
- On page load, saved preference is checked and applied
- Preference persists across page reloads and sessions

## Testing Performed

### Visual Testing
- Verified all elements are visible in both themes
- Checked contrast ratios for accessibility
- Verified chart readability in both themes
- Tested transitions and animations

### Functional Testing
- Verified theme toggle works correctly
- Confirmed theme persistence across page reloads
- Tested chart updates in both themes
- Verified all interactive elements remain functional

### Cross-browser Testing
- Tested in modern browsers
- Verified CSS variables support
- Checked Font Awesome icon rendering

### Mobile Testing
- Verified responsive design in both themes
- Tested touch interactions with toggle
- Confirmed chart readability on mobile

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
- Add system theme detection
- Implement smoother chart color transitions
- Add theme-specific chart annotations
- Consider adding more theme options

### Known Limitations
- Initial chart load may flash in default theme
- Some chart plugins may not fully support theme changes
- Complex charts may require additional color considerations

## Code Structure Impact
- Maintained separation of concerns
- Added modular theme management
- Integrated with existing chart initialization
- Preserved existing functionality while adding theme support
