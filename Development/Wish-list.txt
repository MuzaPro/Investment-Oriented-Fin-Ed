Features we must add or modify:

************
Dark mode
************


************
the chart animated to appear from scratch every time the values are modified by the user. if possible- it would be better if the chart could adjust instead of animating. 
Even if it changes with a 'jump' and no animation it would still be more clear to the viewer.
************



************
when we expand the 'learn more...' sections, it changes the chart size (big stretch vertically), 
which is actually nice, but we need the chart to adjust back when we close the expended section.
************


************
The monthly contribution input is nice but not ideal.
If people are using 1000 (the default value) for their initial investment, then adding a monthly 100 (which is 10%) is not very realistic.
The range is 1 to 1000, which is very convinient to adjust but not very informative in this context.
We need to consider a free style input or find some way to adjust the numbers in the slider to carry more meaning.

One way I would consider to use this tool is by noting to the user that the numbers are all in thousands. Then we would typically start with ~80-150k and the monthly contribution would be 800-2000 NIS (not thousands)


I know that the next page let's the user run wild and put any number they'd like, but still, we should find a way to make page 4 more meaningful.

************
The visuals on the first page with the SVG of coins is very good. we should add a visual touch to every page.
