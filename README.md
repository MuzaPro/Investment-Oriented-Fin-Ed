## About The Project

This interactive calculator was designed as an educational tool to help explain basic investment concepts in a simple, progressive way. It walks users through the fundamental concepts of:

1. **The impact of inflation** on savings over time
2. **The power of investment returns** to combat inflation
3. **The multiplier effect** of regular monthly contributions

The application uses visual storytelling and interactive elements to make abstract financial concepts tangible and accessible to beginners.

- **Comprehensive Calculator**: Final step with complete control over all parameters
- **Visual Insights**: Key takeaways highlighted at each step

- The power of compound growth increases dramatically with time
- Regular contributions, even small ones, can multiply results exponentially
- Starting early has a profound impact on long-term results
